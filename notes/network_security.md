# Network Security Basics

Network security involves protecting systems and data in transit. This includes:

- **Scanning**: Identifying open ports on a target system.
- **Sniffing**: Capturing raw network packets.
- **Common Attacks**: DoS, spoofing, ARP poisoning.

Tools like `nmap`, `tcpdump`, and `Wireshark` are commonly used. In this repo, we use Python to simulate basic scanning and sniffing behavior.
